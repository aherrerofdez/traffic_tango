# Traffic Tango Game

## Overview

This is a simple car racing game built using Python and Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game allows the player to control a car and avoid obstacles while racing on a track. It offers two modes: player mode, where the user controls the car manually using arrow keys or on-screen buttons, and computer mode, where the car is controlled by AI.

## Features

- Player mode: Control the car using arrow keys or on-screen buttons.
- Computer mode: Let the AI control the car while you sit back and watch.
- Multiple difficulty levels: Choose from easy, medium, or hard difficulty levels, each with different track parameters.
- Obstacle avoidance: Dodge obstacles on the track to prevent crashes.
- Endless racing: Race against time and see how far you can go without crashing.
